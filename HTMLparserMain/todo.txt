ToDo:

1) Adding more NUnit test cases (you can help here...)
 
2) Improve documentation/comments (primitive one generated with NDOC)

3) More performance - using pointers and bitmap masks might give some gains,
   also some rearrangement of tag parsing code should yield more performance
   let me know if you managed to improve performance!
